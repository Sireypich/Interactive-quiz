# Interactive-quiz
This is a Hogwarts House Sorting Quiz.
This project lets you take a quiz to find out which Hogwarts house you belong to. Just like in the wizarding world, your answers to magical questions will determine if you're a Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin.
## How to Play
1. Open the Python file named hogwarts_quiz.py in your favorite code editor or IDE.

2. Run the program, and a series of questions will appear. You'll need to type a letter (a, b, c, or d) to answer each question.

3. Each question represents different traits and choices. Your answers will help the quiz determine the house that matches your personality the best.

4. After you answer all the questions, the quiz will tell you which Hogwarts house you belong to based on your answers.

5. Enjoy the magical experience of being sorted into your house!
## Prerequisites
